`extended.klc`

Windows keyboard layout similar to MacOS's "ABC Extended" (was "US Extended")
keyboard, regarding my language's accented characters.

It's not a perfect match, because I can set up "dead key" accents only on AltGr.
Because of this, I also use Microsoft PowerToys to redefine for example `WIN+E`
to `AltGr+E`, etc.

To be used with Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator (MSKLC) from:

The `exe`, `msi`, `dll` files are actually generated by MSKLC.
(This is how it works...)
